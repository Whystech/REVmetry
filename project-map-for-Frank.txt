Hi Frank!

The structure of this project is ambiguous to say the least. 
To make your life easier (hopefully) I will write below some directions.

- The python folder:
Contains the python programs needed for the telemetry.

envsensors, spatialsensors - SenseHAT spatialsensors
obdReceiver - manages the connection and data gathering of the OBD receiver
gpsReceiver - manages the connection and data gathering of the GPS receiver
rpmIndicatorv2 - contains a some unused code used for testing - simulated_RPM() and rpmIndicator() are the only active functions
telemetry - use this one if you have all the sensors (live tesing in a car)
telemetry-simulated - use this to use simulated data (mostly using randints) - didn't use packet tracer since the simulated data comes from live sensors that are either USB or bluetooth
lights - just a check mark

- REVmetry Dashboard:

Within the services folder mqtt.js manages the MQTT connection as well as the WebSocket Server.

Within the views folder, dashboard.hbs manages the live data (gauges, map, web socket client).
Now, since there is a bit of mix between handlebars and javascript, there was no reliable way (or I didn't manage to find it) to separate the scripts from the view.

I couldn't use the WebSockets fully; as in, they don't trigger the DOM update, I used setIntervals - almost polling.
The rest it's just adapted from the Weather App - but with some functionality removed (cookies, users).

There is one big "game-breaking" bug in the trip controller. 
Meaning: only one trip can be started, there is no "state" set per trip; If there are multiple users visiting at the same time , all users can stop a trip or start a trip at any time.
Now this is also because I removed the cookies functionality, tried to strip down the app as much as possible.
Maybe should have started from scratch but I am pretty happy with it as it is.
